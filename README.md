# Cooling System Analysis Engine

This project implements an NLP-based analysis engine for processing and analyzing cooling system maintenance reports. It uses state-of-the-art natural language processing techniques to extract insights from maintenance data.

## Features

- BERT-based text analysis for maintenance reports
- Efficient device management (supports CPU, CUDA, and MPS)
- Robust error handling and logging
- Caching mechanisms for improved performance
- Database integration for maintenance records

## Technical Stack

- Python 3.11
- PyTorch
- Transformers (Hugging Face)
- NLTK
- pandas
- pyodbc

## Setup

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install torch transformers nltk pandas pyodbc
```

3. Run the Jupyter notebook:
```bash
jupyter notebook cs_engine_fin.ipynb
```
